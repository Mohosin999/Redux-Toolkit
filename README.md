## 📘 What is TypeScript?

A JavaScript's Superset created by Microsoft.

- Allows static strict typing
- Gives us extra features - interfaces, enums, tuples, generics
- Supports modern features (arrow functions, let, const)
- Based on the .NET harmony specification
- Errors during compile time (awesome developer experience)

Our browser can't understand TypeScript, it somehow compile to JavaScript.

## 🚫 What's Wrong with JavaScript?

- JavaScript is not suitable for larger applications
- Lacks strong typing
- Weird inheritance, unfamiliar syntax
- Only errors during runtime
- Suffers type coercion

- Compiles to JavaScript - runs everywhere
- Familiar OOP
- New features work everywhere

## 🛠️ Install TypeScript

- Install Node.js in your machine (no need if already installed)

npm i -g typescript
```
